					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t seem to get SIMBL to install on my snow leopard. I keep getting the message: The installation failed. The installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail. I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m doing wrong. Can anyone help?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess that was the main problem. There&#039;s a bug somewhere, though. Because I had deleted the old input manager, and then, when MC lost all my old preference settings, and I went to recreate them, the preference pane required me to reinstall the old manager. and then the crashing and the two-finger scroll panics ensued...

I uninstalled everything, reinstalled everything, deleted the old manager, rebooted, and now things seem to work fine again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[elspub: It looks like you have both the old Multiclutch input manager and the new SIMBL plugin. Can you remove the old input manager (As the new one will work in both 32 bit and 64 bit, and should support all applications).

Let me know if that fixes it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe it&#039;s just me... I&#039;m experiencing another bug. This one is a lot harder to put my finger on. Somehow Multiclutch lost all my preference settings. 

Now, if I go to set them up again, open the MC preference pane, click plus to add an app, and attempt to scroll down using the two-finger scroll i get the ole&#039; Spinning Beach Ball.... Have to force quit.  Since I can&#039;t upload direct here, here&#039;s a link to download some of my log which tracks the issues... It might be SIMBL not your inputmanager or MC.

Let me know if it is and I&#039;ll email this onto the SIMBL developers...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, want to say thanks, this works great!

This is what I did to get it working (I thought this might be handy to others as this mightn&#039;t necessarily be that clear to all)
1. Installed Multiclutch
2. Installed SIMPL
3. Added this bundle to the SIMPL plugins folder
4. Removed Multiclutch Input Manager

FYI, found this from comments on the Multiclutch site. Hopefully an update is added to the blog post so that more people can find this! Great work!]]></description>
