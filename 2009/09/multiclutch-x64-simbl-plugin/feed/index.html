					<description><![CDATA[No worries! I was quite sure I uploaded the file, but just in case, can you try this link too:
http://blog-old.prashantv.com/files/multiclutch/AirKeysInputManager.bundle2.zip

If it crashes, can you open Console, choose &quot;system.log&quot;, clear the display, run firefox again, make it crash, and copy whatever is shown on the Console log and email it to me (so I know what caused it to crash).

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Prashant,

  I can&#039;t believe you got onto this so fast -- great. I tried the new .bundle (did I get the right link? http://blog-old.prashantv.com/files/multiclutch/AirKeysInputManager.bundle.zip).

  It seems not to have fixed the problem on my machine. I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s not very helpful feedback...

But your idea of assigning all the gestures in the prefpane for Firefox does work, in principle. So assigning three finger swipes stops them crashing Firefox (and they do implement the assigned shortcut). The problem for me is that two-fingered scrolling also crashes Firefox, and there is no option to assign shortcuts to this gesture in the Multiclutch prefpane.

Thanks for all the time you&#039;ve already spent on this. I should try learning something about all this instead of just complaining... If you would like any other info, let me know....

Thanks again....]]></description>

<p>Thanks for all the time you&#8217;ve already spent on this. I should try learning something about all this instead of just complaining&#8230; If you would like any other info, let me know&#8230;.</p>
<p>Thanks again&#8230;.</p>

Just a small update - I think I fixed the crashing. I&#039;ve uploaded it to the same spot, so redownload it and try :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah I was able to reproduce it for a few gestures. Can you try creating a shortcut in the prefpane for all gestures.

The problem seems to be that some gestures aren&#039;t being handled by multiclutch, and so they are sent to Firefox, which doesn&#039;t expect it and crashes. So if Multiclutch handles all the gestures, it should work fine in FF.

I am not yet sure how to fix it properly for future though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is amazing... Fantastic job! One problem, however, is that the AirKeysInputManager.bundle causes Firefox to crash following any trackpad gestures (except single-finger mouse positioning and clicking). Do you think this has an easy fix?]]></description>
