					<description><![CDATA[I uninstalled MultiClutch long ago, but it still pops up in my log every time I launch an app. Of course I don&#039;t care about it just appearing in the log, but it also seems to be silently changing the tracking speed of my mouse, so I have to reset it every day or so.

I&#039;ve looked in both the system and user InputMangaer and SIMBL folders, and I&#039;ve done spotlight searched the system files for &quot;multiclutch.&quot; But I can&#039;t find any other files to uninstall. 

Any idea why there might still be a ghost of MultiClutch in my computer?

Thanks for any help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David, I am unsure but doubtful that it would help.

I have moved on to using BetterTouchTool myself, and would recommend it. It seems to be working with every app I&#039;ve tried.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been using multiClutch with SL in 32bit for the basic editing functions: copy, paste, cut. It works fine with three finger swipes in Word. But it doesn&#039;t work for me  in the xml editor Oxygen 12.1. Is switching to your 62bit version likely to resolve this issue?

Cheers &#038; no matter what, thanks for your great efforts!

					<description><![CDATA[Justin: If you installed the bundle properly, you can find it, if not, then I have no idea...

patrick: never had any problems once you relaunch finder. Perhaps try BetterTouchTool as it is being actively developed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Addendum: it only seems to stop working if a space I scroll to has no windows open in it. Guess if the focus is on Finder it doesn&#039;t want to work?  It works again after relaunching Finder, but only for a bit. Strange.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s working intermittently for me. I have left and right set up as option-left arrow and option-right arrow respectively, which I then set to scroll through spaces. Oddly enough, though, I can only get it to switch once; I can&#039;t scroll through them. If I click on an open window, then try again, it works again. But it looks like it&#039;s a one-off thing without some sort of activity in between.  (I switched it to show all spaces on swipe, which makes the bug less limiting.)]]></description>
