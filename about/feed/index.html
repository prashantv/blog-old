					<description><![CDATA[buddy, you are the MAN. i hated snow leopard until today. i was also running it in 32bit just to use multiclutch. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS. i was wondering if you knew where i could get information on how to change back to the leopard version of command ` (tilde) where the windows in one application would continue to cycle in the same order opened as opposed to SL where the windows now cycle in an odd order (once a window is changed the the cycle changes). i have contacted apple, but they are no help.
