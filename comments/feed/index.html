					<description><![CDATA[I uninstalled MultiClutch long ago, but it still pops up in my log every time I launch an app. Of course I don&#039;t care about it just appearing in the log, but it also seems to be silently changing the tracking speed of my mouse, so I have to reset it every day or so.

I&#039;ve looked in both the system and user InputMangaer and SIMBL folders, and I&#039;ve done spotlight searched the system files for &quot;multiclutch.&quot; But I can&#039;t find any other files to uninstall. 

Any idea why there might still be a ghost of MultiClutch in my computer?

Thanks for any help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David, I am unsure but doubtful that it would help.

I have moved on to using BetterTouchTool myself, and would recommend it. It seems to be working with every app I&#039;ve tried.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been using multiClutch with SL in 32bit for the basic editing functions: copy, paste, cut. It works fine with three finger swipes in Word. But it doesn&#039;t work for me  in the xml editor Oxygen 12.1. Is switching to your 62bit version likely to resolve this issue?

Cheers &#038; no matter what, thanks for your great efforts!

					<description><![CDATA[Bliz: I would recommend using the latest version of PMS, which already has this feature inbuilt now.

The folder depth should not matter, as it shows up under &quot;Media Library&quot; for &quot;Audio&quot;, and it displays artists etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I tried replacing pms.jar.  It looks like it will work great, except that I&#039;m running into the PS3&#039;s folder depth limit:

C:/Users/name/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Music

I tried adding the iTunes Music folder under the Folders Sharing tab (I believe this creates a &quot;symbolic link&quot;), and that adds the iTunes folder, but doesn&#039;t fix the iTunes Library access problem.  Any ideas for a solution?]]></description>
