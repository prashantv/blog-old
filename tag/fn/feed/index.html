										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu 8.10 does not support the Vaio FS series by default, and needs a little bit of hacking to get working. The old fsfn program does not work anymore unfortunately. Some poking around found me this error in my dmesg output everytime I pressed a FN key: </p>
<blockquote><p>atkbd.c: Use &#8216;setkeycodes e075 &lt;keycode&gt;&#8217; to make it known.<br />
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0xf5 on isa0060/serio0).</p></blockquote>
<p>This was repeated multiple times. I also found that a file located at /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/fnkey had the right value after a FN key press.</p>
<p>I realised I could combine these to come up with a hack solution that would work. I decided to write a perl script that would be called everytime a fn key was pressed, that would figure out which key was pressed (using the fnkey file) and then do the right thing.</p>
<p>To get the key recognised to start our perl script, we use xbindkeys and we use the setkeycodes command. I made a <a href="http://blog-old.prashantv.com/files/vaio_fs/vaio_keys.sh">script </a>that maps all FN keys to keycode 235. I then use this <a href="http://blog-old.prashantv.com/files/vaio_fs/xbindkeysrc">.xbindkeysrc</a> (it must be named .xbindkeysrc in your home directory and you need to install xbindkeys) to start my perl script.</p>
<p>The perl script itself just invokes some scripts that come with ubuntu. At the moment it only supports the volume controls and brightness (as these are what I wanted). The script is located <a href="http://blog-old.prashantv.com/files/vaio_fs/vaio_keys.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out the ubuntu scripts need root access to run, so I ran the following commands to ensure all executions of the program run as root (I wasn&#8217;t too worried about security in this case..)</p>
<blockquote><p>sudo chmod a+s /etc/acpi/sonybright.sh<br />
sudo chmod a+s /usr/bin/acpi_fakekey </p></blockquote>
<p>My files use hardcoded paths of /home/prashant so you will have to change those to make it work.</p>
<p>All the files needed can be found here:<br />
<a href="http://blog-old.prashantv.com/files/vaio_fs/">http://blog-old.prashantv.com/files/vaio_fs/</a> </p>
<p>I took a look at the driver (/drivers/misc/sony-laptop.c) and realised that fn keys do not generate any event in the sony-laptop code currently, and seem to only generate normal keyboard events. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have any experience with the linux kernel to figure out how to fix it at the kernel level.</p>
